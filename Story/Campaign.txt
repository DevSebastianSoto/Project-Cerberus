Campaign:

Day 1
The Travelers Guide 

    Today is 12/10/3085. The crew is getting ready to get back to base. We have all the resources we need for the investigation. I guess we can cross planet 10AF91 off the list. We don't know what is producing the time fluxes, yet. We're heading back to the mothership.

Day 2
Going Home

    I still don't like that we have to live in the mothership, I know we humans destroyed earth about 3 centuries ago, but it's so sad that to this day, we haven't found a similar place to live. I have never experienced the breeze through my hair or water from the ocean in my feet. Virtual reality is so advanced you may forget where you are, but it is not real after all.

Day 3
In Space

    Yesterday, after I finished my report, something happened. We were about a parsec away from reaching our destination when the entire ship started shaking, I thought the pilot got into some kind of asteroid belt and the rocks were hitting us, but when I saw through the window... There it was something that looked like a black hole but was not there a few seconds ago. The ship got dragged to it and then it was all quiet. After the event,it felt like a some kind of time travel because just as the ship got back to normal we were according to the ship, at the same time it was before the ship got dragged, but with a major difference... The mothership was not on course and we had no idea where we were.
