Projet Cerberus

Chapter 1
Sebastian

    The year is A7x912. The moment has come, the time when our Sun is about to die and we must leave this solar system. Humans have already managed to populate Mars and other planets outside the solar system, but we are the last human colony from Earth. All colonies from Mars evacuated the solar system and are heading to the meeting point we agreed, it is near the 3ABF10 cuadrant.

    Each family has a ship, and 4 specialized members according to the HSR (Human Survival Rules). The first specialist is a mechanical engineer that can fix anything related to the ship. Then there should be a soldier or someone able to thrive at unknown environments. Even though the ship has an AIDoc incorporated, there must be a doctor that can take care of the crew in case the ship has a problem or needs fixing before being able to help. And last but not least, a biologyst just in case there is a chance we encounter some form of living organism that is not documented yet. In case you were wondering, I am the engineer. My father is the doctor, my sister the biologyst and my mother is the soldier. It's sad my brother could not pass the test to be a biologyst too, I guess he was not motivated enough with the planet about to die... What could we do, after all, he is just like that.
    I can't even believe this is happening, A few million years ago, people thought our race wouldn't even live to be a part of this event. Global warming was one of the biggest issues they had. At least that is what I learned at the VR school. But now there is so much more we know, galaxies the greatest telescopes at the time couldn't even get close to observing.
